📝 Recipe App
============
As crudités are essentially a veggie platter with a fancy French name, CRU·Di·tés is a MEN-stack app with a fancy name because CRUD Platter doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue.

CRU·Di·tés was created with one focus in mind, just the recipe. Users are able to create, read, update, and delete recipes to your heart's content, but descriptions and comments have a max character count of 280 characters, or you will be chopped!


CRU·Di·tés was created by Paul Corpuz with a focus on just cooking. Descriptions and comments have a max character count of 280 characters, so make sure to make it count!
